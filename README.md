# Day 1 – Sum of N Natural Numbers (C Language)

🚀 This repository is part of my **daily DSA consistency challenge**, where I solve and upload **one DSA problem every day** starting from **basic to advanced level** using **C language**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a C program to calculate the **sum of first N natural numbers**.

---

## 🧠 Approaches Used
1. **Loop-based approach** – Basic logic using `for` loop  
2. **Mathematical formula** – Optimized solution using `n*(n+1)/2`  
3. **Input validation** – Handles invalid or negative input
